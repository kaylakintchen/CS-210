Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project integrated python with C++ to allow a user to select between 4 different options on how to manipulate a text list of groceries.

What did you do particularly well?
Having never used Python before, I did a good job getting used to it quickly.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I misunderstood the directions and used python more than it seems I should have. I could definitely improve my code by using more classes. 

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found the file output to be the most difficult. I worked with a tutor and realized that I didn't close the previous file and it wouldn't allow me to have both open at the same time. 

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
My newfound knowledge of python.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
It can be used with any text file.
